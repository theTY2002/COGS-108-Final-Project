    "Twitter is a widely used social media platform for expressing many kinds of opinions, including those on certain companies. We believe that this may have an impact on the public perception of these companies, and we aim to investigate whether there is a connection between opinions expressed in social media and the actual stock prices of the companies in question. An example of was seen this back in 2021, when “a thread on r/WallStreetBets”  caused “more than 7,200% increase in GME—and a 689% run”<a name=\"cite_note-1\"></a> <sup>[<a href=\"#cite_ref-1\">1</a>]</sup> . This occurence informed us that there is a potential causal effect between opinions on social media and real-world stock prices; we think that this effect has a much greater scope than just this isolated case of GameStop stocks, and we are interested in seeing if this is a larger, more general phenomenon that can be applied to other time periods and companies.\n",
    "\n",
    "When reading a research paper from the IOP conference series, we found a sentiment analysis model based on social media opinion on stock trading. It was remarked in the conclusion that “looking into correlation coefficient compared by number of days before and after the trading day, the result shows that correlation reaches to the peak on trading day then it gradually declines with the magnitude depending on the day length after trading day.” <a name=\"cite_note-2\"></a> <sup>[<a href=\"#cite_ref-2\">2</a>]</sup> This research is similar to what we aim to investigate, as the paper conducted their test on a Thai social media platform called Pantip, and discussed ten Thai companies. The paper provides more evidence that there is a causal link between social media sentiment and stock prices, and we are interested to see if a similar trend can be seen with tweets and tech companies' stocks in the US. Additionally, we would also like to investigate if there are other similarities or differences in the trends that we are able to identify between our research and the paper, such as the correlation between variables reaching a peak on trading day.\n",

    "Before answering our research question by investigating the available data, we think that there will be a positive correlation between a positive sentiment for a company and said company’s stock prices rising, as well as a positive correlation between a negative sentiment for a company and said company’s stock prices falling. This is due to the connection between a company’s public perception, how that is reflected in social media, and how it manifests in the stock market. If tweets about a company are mostly negative within a certain time period, we would expect to observe a decrease in stock prices, as both phenomena correspond to a decrease in public perception of the company. However, we also acknowledge that this relationship may not be as straightforward as is stated here, as there may be other confounds affecting each variable, such as Twitter only capturing the sentiment of a more vocal sample of people as compared to the rest of the population."

    "The first dataset, Tweet Stock, is a collection of tweets that talk about TSLA, the stock for the company Tesla. The time range for this datasets is from September 30th, 2021 to September 29th, 2022, and was chosen  since we are unable to obtain current Twitter data, and need to rely on past data that has already been collected. The two important variables in this dataset are the dates that the tweets were posted, as well as the tweets themselves. The tweets are in the form of strings, and the dates will be converted into a standard Timestamp format. The tweets in this dataset will be used as a proxy for social media opinion, once it is processed by a sentiment analysis model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second dataset, TESLA_HISTORICAL, is a record of prices of the TSLA stock on each day from September 30th, 2021 to September 29th, 2022. This time range was chosen to match the time range of the other dataset. In the dataset, the highest, lowest, and open/close prices of the stock are recorded as floats in each row, along with the corresponding day, which will be converted into a standard Timestamp format. These variables can provide insight into how a stock varies within a day, and comparing these across different days can lead to potential trends over time. The prices are a direct factual record of TSLA prices, although further numerical processing may be needed later to reveal meaningful trends.\n",
